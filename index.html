        <p class="cape-reason">
            I have always wanted to go to Cape Town because its a beautiful city with  a lot of sightseeing.
            While there I could visit Robben Island and see the prison cell of the former president of South Africa  president Nelson Mandela and learn amore about what happend during this imprisonment.
            Again I have always wanted to visit Table Mountain because it is one of the most talked about landmarks in South Africa and apparently it has the best view of Cape Town. The best wineries in the country are in Cape Town, I would like to visit there and see how wine is made.
            I believe there are alot of activities that side, that's why it is the city I would like to visit.

            I would like to learn Spanish as a foreign language because it is in the top 5 of the most well know foreign languages and I think it would be easier to learn as compared to the other ones.

            Mapungube was an early kingdom in southern Africa. It was in the
            northern part of what is now South Africa, where the Limpopo province
            is today.Mapungubwe was the largest kingdom in southern Africa until
            it was abandoned in about ad 1300.The name Mapungubwe means “hill of
            the jacka". In 1933 archaeologists began digging at Mapungubwe. They
            discovered many ancient objects. Some items, such as Chinese ceramics,
            are evidence of foreign trade. The best-known object found at the site
            is a small golden rhinoceros. The rhinoceros figurine was made more
            than 800 years ago.

            and is about the same size as Wales. Firstly, did you know that the
            Kruger National Park is the largest game reserves in Africa? It spans
            across 19,633 square kilometers. That's just smaller than the size of

            27,000 African Buffalo, 2,000 leopards and 2,800 lions. It's also
